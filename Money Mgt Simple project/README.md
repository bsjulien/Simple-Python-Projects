This is a program that can help users to do various banking operations without physical movement of
cash rather this can be cashless. Our program has three classes called Account,
customer account, and business account and all of these will have different methods.

The program has two initial accounts(users) that are defined in account_def file and its the only
ones that are used in running the program.

Login credentials might be:

For business account

name = kenny
password = 4321

For customer account

name = christian
password = 1234

Additionally, in order to create the file that will record each user entry,
the above login credentials(name) must be entered as the username at the start of the program and the filename
with that username will be created.

There are no modules required to install in order run the program

here is the link to the recording where we run the program:
